# Instagram Political Bias Research üîç

Academic research investigating political bias in social media algorithms through automated data collection and machine learning analysis.

## What This Research Does

This study examines how Instagram's algorithm creates political filter bubbles by systematically collecting and analyzing recommendation patterns across different user personas. In part 2, we also recreated a 2019 paper that created its own model to detect political bias in images.

## Example of part 1: the scraper building a database of accounts with their political leaning

## Why This Research Matters

**The Problem:** Social media algorithms create "echo chambers" that reinforce existing political beliefs, potentially polarizing society. Understanding how these systems work is crucial for digital literacy and informed civic participation.

**Our Approach:** By creating controlled experiments with bot accounts, we can systematically study algorithmic bias without relying on self-reported user data or proprietary company information.

**Academic Impact:** This research contributes to the growing field of algorithmic auditing and provides methodologies for studying recommendation systems across social platforms.

## Research Components
